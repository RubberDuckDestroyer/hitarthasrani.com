## Event Storming Concepts

Collaborate with customers.
Undestand problem domain
Problem contains few pieces of opportunity

Start with a few questions
analyse requirements? (dev perspective)
design decisions?
Have an event/spec document
Might be out of date

Ubiquitous Language (Commonly understood, within boundaries. Contains business events. Everyone needs to know the meaning of the service)
Bounded context

Domain event - verb in past tense. Orange Note, relevant to domain
Immutable past

Customer will show process -> You might need to go into more detail or prioritise. MVP Approach.
