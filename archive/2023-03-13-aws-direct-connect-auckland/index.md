On the 10th of March, AWS announced a new AWS Direct Connect location in Auckland. This is part of the new AWS Region planned for Auckland.

## AWS Direct Connect?

AWS Direct Connect is AWS's service to create a dedicated network connection to AWS. Any company that wants to connect their exisitng on-premisis solutions or network to AWS should have a way to connect their resoruces to AWS, especially if they do not want to use the public internet for this.

The benefits this brings are mainly around security, reliability (with regards to latency), 

Setting up Hybrid connectivity can be an integral part of any enterprise's cloud journey. I can think of two scenarios where this new Direct Connect location can be helpfuk:

1. Any kiwi business looking at migrating to AWS; and specifically wanting to utilise the upcoming Auckland Region instead of the existing Sydney (ap-southeast-2) region.
2. Any kiwi business that already uses AWS and has set up Direct Connect using one of the Sydney locations.
