## RubberDuckDestroyer Developer Environment.

This is the dev environment for the [RDD blog](https://blog.rubberduckdestroyer.dev), using [Gatsby](https://gatsbyjs.org), and Gatsby's blog starter.

#### About Gatsby
Gatsby uses React and GrphQL to create static pages. Currently all static pages are on the master branch, while the development branch has the pages in a dynamic/server side layout.

#### Instructions and commands:
* `npm run dev` will push all changes from the development branch to the master branch, converting the data to a static website at the same time.
* `gatsby develop` will build the local environment on localhost:8000.
